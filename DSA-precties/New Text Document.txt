Dry Run of the Code:
Input:

nums1 = [1, 2, 3, 0, 0, 0]
m = 3
nums2 = [2, 5, 6]
n = 3
Line by line:

for (let l = m; l < m + n; l++) {:

l starts at 3 (m) and ends at 5 (m + n).
This loop iterates through the empty spaces in nums1 where merged elements will be placed.
nums1[l] = nums2[l - m];:

Within the loop, l is used as an index in both nums1 and nums2 with offset by m.
This line copies each element from nums2 into the corresponding empty space in nums1.
After the loop, nums1 becomes [1, 2, 3, 2, 5, 6].
for (let i = 0; i < nums1.length; i++) {:

This loop iterates through the entire nums1 array for sorting.
for (let j = 0; j < nums1.length; j++) {:

This nested loop compares each element with every other element within nums1.
if (nums1[i] < nums1[j]) {:

This conditional checks if the current element (i) is less than the element being compared to (j).
let temp = nums1[i];:

If the condition holds, a temporary variable stores the value of the current element (i).
nums1[i] = nums1[j];:

The current element (i) is overwritten with the value of the compared element (j).
nums1[j] = temp;:

Finally, the temporary variable containing the previous value of element (i) is assigned to the compared element (j).
return nums1;:

After the nested loop finishes comparing and swapping elements, the sorted nums1 array is returned.
Output:

The final sorted array is: nums1 = [1, 2, 2, 3, 5, 6].
This dry run demonstrates how the code merges and sorts the elements of nums1 and nums2 into the desired output.

Note: This code is inefficient for this specific case as it performs unnecessary comparisons and swaps during the sorting process. A more efficient approach like merge sort would be better suited for this situation.
